#This is my project
The readme will go there. It's about word clouds and recognising text types.
The article this project is based on used news articles from differing sources and with differing subject types (eg. sports, business, etc). I elected to use different texts, easier to obtain in plaintext (and without paywalls), such as Simpsons episode transcripts.
Texts go through some preparation before wordclouds are generated: the top 100 words in the English language are automatically culled, as well as proper nouns.
